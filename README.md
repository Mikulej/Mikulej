### Hello!
My name is Micha≈Ç. I am a Computer Science graduate, pursuing my dream of becoming a software developer.
### About What I Do/Did
Currently, in my job I do test automation.  
In the past I made a few simple rendering engines with OpenGL, nowadays - I'm developing a small game in my free time.  
I'm familiar with main concepts of deep learning, also made one reinforcement learning model as well for my diploma.  
I mainly program in C++ and Python.
### About Me
I'm keen to build projects that seem cool or are helpful to other people.  
I'm fond of learning new stuff and concepts, especially from colleagues.
